learned about crypto a long time ago... but faded it

then on 2020, i had the idea to redistribute profits with my frens on some digital products i had created and they were also wanting to sell it... thought crypto could be the key and joined this world

i ended up using $DOGE before price went up and that got my interest even more

a couple months later i found $LUNA (which i rode to the top until it crashed)

during 2021 and 2022 i learned about cosmos, decentralized finance, and all the different things that could be done in crypto

i lived in cryptoland for 16-18 hours a day

and i used multiple "hats":

investor, degen, developer (taught myself rust and learned cosmwasm to create "equippable" nfts), created the largest Spanish group on Terra, rose to prominence on twitter, played the influencer game, was hired by delphi labs to grow astroport and mars (which grew to 1.4B and 700M in mcap), and so on

after the crash i stayed on the sidelines, rode the ai wave by growing leonardo.ai(leonardo.ai) from 0 to 1
its discord became the the 5th largest server in the world and leonardo amassing 1m subscribers in 5 months

the ai bug bite didn't last for long and i felt the time was ready to enter some positions in crypto to ride the cycle once again
