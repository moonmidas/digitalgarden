title: The Crypto Bluechips 
---

When playing [[the hodling game|The Long Term Hodling Game]] we should look for established projects that are considered safer and less volatile.

The two most recognized bluechips are Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is because they have the longest track records, widest adoption, and most institutional interest.

As opposed to other crypto assets, bluechips don't experience the same parabolic runs as newer projects.

However... they can still appreciate significantly over multi-year time frames.

These bluechips are also less susceptible to complete failure risk compared to smaller cap projects
