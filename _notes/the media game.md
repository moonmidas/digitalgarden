title: The Media Game

"So you wanna be a rock superstar? And live large? A big house? Five cars? You're in charge" â€” Cypress Hill

Oh my, oh my... the good ol' communication game.

See, in [[planet crypto|Planet Crypto]], information is currency... and power.

Those who can effectively communicate insights, news, and analysis can build significant influence and profit from their role in the media ecosystem.

The Media Game, in essence, is the battle for attention and influence in the crypto space. 

It's played across social media platforms like X, Telegram, Discord, YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, and Twitch. 

We can divide it into two types of brands:
- Corporate Brands
- Personal Brands

Corporate Brands are those that act as a conglomerate of people behind it. Their image is "professional", with a logo, website, and so on.

Personal Brands on the other hand are managed by individuals. These are influencers, thought leaders, and self-proclaimed experts.

Both type of brands build a following based on their insights, predictions, or entertainment value.

Now, think, what will be your focus?

Do you enjoy reading news about the crypto world? 

Do you enjoy making predictions, or have any knowledge on technical or fundamental analysis?

Do you enjoy educating people on the intricacies of the crypto world?

Or perhaps you enjoy shitposting and have a natural affinity to being funny?

Whatever it is, the first thing to do is to choose your path and start creating content about it.

But don't stop there, when you don't have a large following you have to distribute that content everywhere you can. 

When starting you should look for a 80/20 ratio: 80% distribution, 20% content production.

Say, for example, that you created an X thread. Share this thread with your crypto frens, post it in the groups you hang out, tag some influencers that are just above you (meaning: those that will actually read what you have to say).

Also, for this to work you have to have consistency. Just take a look at how the media game operates outside crypto, they don't create one piece of content and then disappear, right?

So keep producing content, and distributing it.

"But... how do I monetize this?"

Being part of The Media Game has its perks, people will reach out to you with information, deals, and all sorts of opportunities.

But this is also tricky.

You have to realize that your currencies here are attention and reputation. And if you fuck up, they will be gone.
