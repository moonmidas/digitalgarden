title: Planet Crypto 
---

Imagine Crypto as a small replica of our planet... 

On one hand, you've got different countries which are akin to ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and so on.

Every country has infrastructure. 

You have exchanges that make trading currencies easy.

Nodes are similar to physical infrastructure that support each country's operations.

Bridges that allow different countries to exchange data, like international trade routes and border crossings.

Consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and other algorithms are the ones that establish the foundational rules for each blockchain. We could say they're similar to a country's constitution or legal framework that governs the entire nation.

We also have money markets that provide lending and borrowing, in a similar manner to banks and financial institutions in a country's economy.

In our crypto planet, we can also find Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other governance models that make decisions and set policies for the ecosystem, like a country's legislative and executive branches of government.
