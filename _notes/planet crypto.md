title: Planet Crypto

Imagine Crypto as a small replica of our planet... 

On one hand, you've got different countries which are akin to ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and so on.

# Infrastructure
Every country has infrastructure. 

Nodes are similar to physical infrastructure that support each country's operations.

Bridges that allow different countries to exchange data, like international trade routes and border crossings.

Consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and other algorithms are the ones that establish the foundational rules for each blockchain. We could say they're similar to a country's constitution or legal framework that governs the entire nation.

In our crypto planet, we can also find Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other governance models that make decisions and set policies for the ecosystem, like a country's legislative and executive branches of government.

# Businesses and Services

The dApps that exist in every blockchain remind me to businesses and services that create value in each nation (with some of them being transnational businesses).

For example, we have money markets that provide lending and borrowing, in a similar manner to banks and financial institutions in a country's economy.

Or exchanges that make trading currencies easy.

And what about NFT marketplaces? They are akin to art galleries auction houses, or even online marketplaces like Etsy where people buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets such as artwork, collectibles, and virtual real estate. 

In the arena of businesses and services we can also find gambling platforms such as decentralized casinos, or lotteries.
