title: The Hodling Game

This game consists on finding long term projects that can give you an outsized return.

The strategy is simple:
You buy something that others will want in the future [[based on the crypto narratives|the narratives]] that are about to form.

At the moment I'm writing this article, some of the narratives that exist consist on "Crypto AI", "Bitcoin L2", "RWA (Real world assets)", "Restaking", "DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)", "Ordinals".

However, this changes with each cycle.

Last one we had some hot narratives regarding DeFi, Ethereum L2s, NFTs, and so on.

The key components in here are knowing which projects seem legit and will attract other people's attention, and when to exit.

Having a plan is something I've found fundamentally important in order to avoid becoming a "community member" (a hodler who goes down with the project).
